Hi, my name is Woo. I am a ML Research Engineer with 10+ years of experience in **deep learning**, **computer vision**, and **multimodal sensor signal modeling**. I'm skilled in building scalable ML pipelines and CV prototypes, utilizing a wide array of tools and languages, and cross-functional collaboration. I'm passionate about leveraging cutting-edge technologies to enhance user experiences and drive innovation.


Highlighted Work Experiences
======

Meta Reality Labs (Dec 2023 – Dec 2025)
------

- Trained and integrated **CNN-based vision models** enabling mocap-free [haptic glove tracking in VR](https://tech.facebook.com/reality-labs/2021/11/inside-reality-labs-meet-the-team-thats-bringing-touch-to-the-digital-world/), improving tracking accuracy under severe occlusions.
- Developed multimodal signal modeling pipelines integrating diverse sensor inputs (e.g., tactile, IMU, optical, and visual data) into synchronized, display-ready formats to inform sensor hardware strategy.
- Built an automatic data filtration framework that enhanced image dataset quality and eliminated hundreds of hours of manual review.
- Accelerated iteration cycles by 3× through designing and deploying a multi-GPU training pipeline with automation.
- Strengthened collaboration by onboarding and mentoring 3+ research engineers with structured guides and documentation.

Microsoft Research (Jan 2018 – Apr 2023)
------

- **Founding engineer** for [Project S](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-s/), a Microsoft Research initiative exploring AI-driven content understanding and creative assistance.
- Enabled large-scale ML processing by building a scalable Azure cluster handling gigabytes of image and document data.
- Designed and operated an ASP.NET microservice serving tens to hundreds of real-time user requests per day across Cosmos DB, Redis Cache, and Azure Blob Storage for over two years.
- Drove core engineering efforts, including front-end development, telemetry design, product life cycle planning, and cross-team mentorship.

SRI International (Jul 2014 – Oct 2014)
------
<img src="images/facial expression 2 - blurred.png" width="650">

- Designed and developed an **ML-driven 3D facial reconstruction** pipeline converting 2D video to expressive 3D avatars.
- Implemented the model training workflow using Blender Python and built a Unity-based UI for interactive visualization.
- Operated efficiently in a **self-directed remote environment**, completing the full pipeline independently.
