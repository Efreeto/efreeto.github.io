- Trained and integrated **CNN-based vision models** enabling mocap-free [haptic glove tracking in VR](https://tech.facebook.com/reality-labs/2021/11/inside-reality-labs-meet-the-team-thats-bringing-touch-to-the-digital-world/), improving tracking accuracy under severe occlusions.
- Developed multimodal signal modeling pipelines integrating diverse sensor inputs (e.g., tactile, IMU, optical, and visual data) into synchronized, display-ready formats to inform sensor hardware strategy.
- Built an automatic data filtration framework that enhanced image dataset quality and eliminated hundreds of hours of manual review.
- Accelerated iteration cycles by 3× through designing and deploying a multi-GPU training pipeline with automation.
- Strengthened collaboration by onboarding and mentoring 3+ research engineers with structured guides and documentation.
